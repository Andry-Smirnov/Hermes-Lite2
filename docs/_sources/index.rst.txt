Hermes-Lite
===========

The Hermes-Lite is a low-cost direct down/up conversion software defined amateur radio HF transceiver based on a `broadband modem chip <http://www.analog.com/en/broadband-products/broadband-codecs/ad9866/products/product.html>`_ and the `Hermes SDR project <http://openhpsdr.org/wiki/index.php?title=HERMES>`_. It is entirely open source and open hardware, including the tools used for design and fabrication files. Over 100 Hermes-Lite 2.0 units have been successfully built.

Hermes-Lite 2.x
---------------

Current development is focused on the next major version, which combines the FPGA, gigabit ethernet and AD9866 on a single board. Several versions of the Hermes-Lite 2 have been `released <https://github.com/softerhardware/Hermes-Lite2/wiki/Releases>`_.

Hermes-Lite 1.x
---------------

Approximately 100 Hermes-Lite 1.x units have been built by experimenters around the world since 2014. This version requires a companion BeMicro SDK,CV or CVA9 FPGA card which has become difficult to find.
