This directory contains all files necessary to fabricate the N2ADR filter companion board for the Hermes-Lite 2. Elecrow or Makerfabs are the preferred providers.

Only the gerber files in the .zip packages are required if just printed circuit boards are desired. Also, PCBs can be ordered directly online without requesting a bid. The n2adr.zip package contains gerber files.

Changes since N2ADR E4:

 * Added FB1
 * Added 2 capaictors to experiment with noise reduction
 * Rerouted 3.3V power to experiment with noise reduction
 * Pull-up to NAND gate to prevent relay chatter
 * Cut-outs for edge mounted SMA connectors
