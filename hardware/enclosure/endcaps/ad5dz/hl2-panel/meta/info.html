    <h1>HL2 - End Panel</h1>
    <p>
      This is the board outline, mounting holes, and copyright notice 
      for all the end plates of the 
      <a href="http://www.hermeslite.com">Hermes-Lite 2.0</a>
      radio transceiver.
      The board outline is cut small enough to fit inside the 
      105mm wide case outline.
      The mounting holes are spread 0.25mm horizontally 
      to accommodate both the 105mm 
      and 106mm width cases.
