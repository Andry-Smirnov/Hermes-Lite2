This directory contains all files necessary to fabricate the Hermes-Lite 2.0build7 release. Elecrow is the preferred provider as they have and are developing expertise in the Hermes-Lite 2.0.

Only the gerber files in the .zip packages are required if just printed circuit boards are desired. Also, PCBs can be ordered directly online without requesting a bid.

The hermeslite2build7_manual.zip package contains gerber files with large holes present to facilitate manually soldering of the thermal pads. The hermeslite2build7.zip package doesn't contain these holes and is for automated assembly.

See the [interactive BOM](http://www.hermeslite.com/hl2b7-ibom.html) for help with hand assembly.

Changes since hl2beta6:

 * Silkscreen text upated to build7

Stencils, BOMs and Photos from build6 may be used for build7.
